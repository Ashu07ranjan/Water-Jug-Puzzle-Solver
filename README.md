The Water Jug Puzzle Solver is a classic logic-based game where the player must measure a specific amount of water using two jugs of different capacities. The challenge is to determine the correct sequence of steps—filling, emptying, and transferring water between the jugs—to reach the exact target amount.

This project includes:
Python Solver (BFS Algorithm) – Finds the shortest solution

How the Game Works :
Given two jugs with capacities Jug A and Jug B, the player must measure exactly Target (T) liters of water using the following actions:

Fill a jug to its full capacity.

Empty a jug completely.

Pour water from one jug to another until one is empty or the other is full.

Example Scenario

Jug A Capacity: 4 liters

Jug B Capacity: 3 liters

Target: 2 liters
